The purpose is to start a conversation about data science from the food sales company perspective. While we have many different projects going on with numerous stakeholders, for this assignment, weâ€™d like you to focus on one of the most important topics: forecasting demand and customer churn. 

In the files attached, you will find the following data: 

**boxes.csv**
- subscription_id 
- box_id
- delivered_at (when the box was delivered) 
- started_week (when the subscription first began)
- count_boxes (number of total boxes received per subscription so far)
- product (the type of box received)
- channel (the marketing channel through which the customer was acquired)

**pauses.csv**
- subscription_id
- pause_start
- pause_end

**cancels.csv**
- subscription_id
- delivery_weekday (box delivery date) 
- canceled_at (cancellation effective date) 

**errors.csv**
- subscription_id
- refund_amount (amount refunded to customer because of error) 
- created_at (when the error happened) 

Task
=====
Explore the datasets and develop a model to predict either customer churn over time or weekly demand for each product type. 

Good luck!
